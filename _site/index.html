                <p>Rhizal is an <a href="https://github.com/davidgljay/rhizal">open source project</a> of <a href="https://relationalitylab.org">Relationality Lab.</a></p>
                <p>It is an experiment in helping people who build community better understand and connect with the people they serve.</p>
                <p>It is currently in alpha and is available by invitation only.</p>
                <p>Becuase Rhizal is still in early development it should not yet be considered secure, and should be used for light experimentation only.</p>
                <p>To follow our work or see if you're eligible for an invitation,</br> please <a href="https://signal.me/#eu/KfDzAhXoUfD7SnvWdrT5VKo68i0FWEU3GlkPsFiCETlJT-kL_6FIMqImOBqZSSg7">send a Signal message to @rhizal.71</a></p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">How does Rhizal work?</h2>
                <p>Rhizal makes it easy for community organizers to build a chatbot for WhatsApp and/or Signal.</p>
                <p>When community members message this chatbot directly it onboards them.</p>
                <p>After onboarding, it relays messages to the organizer or to a bare-bones secure AI.</p>
                <p>The chatbot can also be invited into group threads.</p>
                <p>Once invited, it will ask the group to come up with a hashtag.</p>
                <p>It will then ignore everything said in the group unless it contains a hashtag.</p>
                <p>If Rhizal detects a hashtag, it will forward the message to the appropriate group and then forget it.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-offset-1 col-lg-10 text-left">
                <h2 class="section-heading">In what ways is Rhizal secure? What are the limits to its security?</h2>
                <p>Rhizal conducts all messaging through Signal or WhatsApp, which are both end-to-end encrypted.</p>
                <p>WhatsApp makes the metadata of who is talking to who available to Meta, while Signal does not store this metadata.</p>
                <p>Messages sent in groups are forwarded by the system and then deleted.</p>
                <p>Note that while these messages are ignored or forgotten, for now they are <i>not</i> end-to-end encrypted. At present, Rhizal decrypts the messages check them for hashtags and to forward them. This is one reason why Rhizal should not yet be used for sensitive applications.</p>
                <p>By default, messages sent to the chatbot are logged and are visible to the organizer and to the Rhizal team.</p>
                <p>These messages can be optionally stored in a database controlled by the organizer or encrypted so they are not visible to the Rhizal team.</p>
                <p>Because Rhizal is an experimental product it has yet to go through rigorous security review and should not yet be used in sensitive contexts.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">What is a "bare-bones secure AI"?</h2>
                <p>By default Rhizal is AI-free, both for security and so organizers can directly control the language sent to their community.</p>
                <p>Optionally, Rhizal can forward messages to a quantized (dumbed down) Large Language Model run on a server that the Rhizal team controls.</p>
                <p>This allows for basic LLM functionality without the cost or security issues associated with a large chatbot provider.</p>

                <p>Rhizal is an <a href="https://github.com/davidgljay/rhizal">open source project</a> of <a href="https://relationalitylab.org">Relationality Lab.</a></p>
                <p>It is an experiment in helping people who build community better understand and connect with the people they serve.</p>
                <p>It is currently in alpha and is available by invitation only.</p>
                <p>Becuase Rhizal is still in early development its security features are not yet fully implemented, we will work with potential partners to ensure that their security needs can be met by the application.
                <p>To follow our work or see if you're eligible for an invitation,</br> please send a Signal message to @rhizal.77 or fill out this form:</p>
